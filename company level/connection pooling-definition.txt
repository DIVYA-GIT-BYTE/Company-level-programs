Connection pooling / Job pooling / Memory pooling
==================================================

It can be defined as , if the modified value is already available in the memory , simply that shares the that reference to the variable , if not existed then that only create a new object with new reference
this is known as connection pooling or memory pooling or job pooling.
We have this pooling in both java and python

For clear understanding:
a=10
print(id(a)) #88
a=a+2        #12
print(id(a)) #20
a=a-2        #10
print(id(a)) #88
